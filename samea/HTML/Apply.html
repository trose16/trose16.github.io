            Are you like many of us women and mothers, trying to find a place of belonging and opportunities that match
            our worth? With Tech-Moms, mothers and women of all ages, backgrounds, ethnicities and more are coming
            together to build an overwhelmingly supportive and empowering community for those who are curious about
            entering the tech world. Through part-time training programs they provide students the opportunity to build
            the skills, knowledge, and professional network needed to transition into or re-enter a career in tech.
